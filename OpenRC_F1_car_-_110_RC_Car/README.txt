This is the OpenR/C Formula 1 car.  It´s the third generation OpenR/C car and this time around focus is on simplicity! You can print everything in PLA except the tires which are done in NinjaFlex! Of course you can print it in any material you like but for those that want to print a car but only have PLA at hand, this is the project for you!

Print the calibration cude to see if you need to finetune your printer for the M3 nuts to fit in their pockets: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2297328

A note on the servo saver. It´s designed to be used with PLA, the upper and lower BOM applies force similar to a spring in a convetional servo saver. Of course the pressure depends on the type of material used, infill etc. Fine tuning can be done adding washer under or over the servo saver.

The "Main Turning Vane´s" needs to have it´s lower part trimmed using a "exacto knife". Then slide it in the chassie plate and push it over the "Lid" and it should snap into place-

Parts that need support added:

Front Spoiler.stl

Front.stl

Rear Rim.stl

Rear Wing.stl

Servo Saver Lower.stl

Things to buy:

Ok, obviously you need some filament which you´ll get from your favourite filament supplier.

You also need M3 screws and nuts which you can get at your local hardware store. Check the BOM list for what to get.

Some bearings are needed aswell, check the BOM list or buy a kit from FastEddyBearings.com: http://www.fasteddybearings.com/openrc-f1-sealed-bearing-kit/
